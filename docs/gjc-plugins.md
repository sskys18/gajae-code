# GJC Plugin Bundles

GJC supports two distinct plugin families. Do not confuse them:

1. **Legacy marketplace / npm plugins** (`packages/coding-agent/src/extensibility/plugins`) — installed through the existing `gjc plugin install <marketplace-ref|npm-spec>` marketplace/npm flows. Unchanged by this system.
2. **GJC plugin bundles** — directories whose root contains a **`gajae-plugin.json`** manifest (`kind: "gajae-code-plugin"`). These *extend* existing GJC capabilities and are the subject of this document.

A GJC plugin bundle may only **extend** existing skills/agents — it can never register a new top-level skill, slash-command, command, or agent. GJC exposes exactly four default workflow skills (`autoresearch`, `deep-interview`, `ralplan`, `ultragoal`) and four role agents (`executor`, `architect`, `planner`, `critic`); bundles add sub-skills/appendices/tools/hooks/MCPs to those existing parents only.

## Loose customization vs plugin bundles

A plugin manifest is **never required** to add one local MCP, hook, skill, or extension. Native loose customization has one canonical destination in each scope: `<project>/.gjc/` for project-local configuration and `~/.gjc/agent/` for user-global configuration. Claude Code and Codex layouts are explicit import sources for `/extensions` ([#4291](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/issues/4291)); they are not parallel runtime authorities. Reach for a bundle only when you want a versioned, distributable package of several surfaces with atomic install/update/uninstall, hashing, quarantine, and collision ownership.

| You want… | Loose surface (no manifest) | Plugin bundle (`gajae-plugin.json`) |
|-----------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **One local MCP server** | `mcpServers` map in `<project>/.gjc/mcp.json` or `~/.gjc/agent/mcp.json`; supports `command`/`args`/`env`/`cwd`/`url`/`headers`/`auth`/`oauth`/`type` | `mcps` array (or the `mcpServers` alias — see below); no `env`/`auth`/`oauth`/`headers` |
| **One local hook** | `<project>/.gjc/hooks/pre/<tool>.ts` / `post/<tool>.ts`, or the same layout under `~/.gjc/agent/hooks/` | `hooks` array of constrained `{ name, event, target?, phase?, path }` entries |
| **One local skill** | `.gjc/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (project) / `~/.gjc/agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (user) | `subskills` entries bound to an existing protected parent (`binds_to`/`phase`/`activation_arg`) |
| **One local extension** | `<project>/.gjc/extensions/<name>/` or `~/.gjc/agent/extensions/<name>/`, with its extension manifest + entry | Bundles have no extension surface; extensions are loose-only |
| **Versioned multi-surface distribution** | — | ✅ Bundle (recommended path) |
| **Atomic install/update/uninstall, hashing, quarantine, collision ownership** | — | ✅ Bundle |
| **A brand-new top-level workflow skill** | ✅ Loose `.gjc/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (never via a bundle) | ❌ Forbidden (`forbidden_surface`) — bundles may only extend the four protected workflow skills |

Rule of thumb: one local surface → loose file; several surfaces you want to version, hash, install atomically, and redistribute → bundle.

Import is a transaction, not discovery precedence: `/extensions` selects Claude Code or Codex plus project-local or user-global scope, previews the normalized result, then writes the accepted configuration into the selected canonical `.gjc` scope. Import UI and transaction behavior belong to #4291; this bundle contract neither activates foreign layouts at runtime nor implements that UI.

## Manifest (`gajae-plugin.json`)

```json
{
  "kind": "gajae-code-plugin",
  "name": "example-domain-bundle",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "subskills": ["subskills/ralplan-design/SKILL.md"],
  "tools": [
    { "name": "domain_note", "path": "tools/domain-note.ts", "description": "..." }
  ],
  "hooks": [
    { "name": "audit-read", "event": "tool_call", "target": "read", "phase": "before", "path": "hooks/audit-read.ts" }
  ],
  "mcps": [
    { "name": "domain_docs", "transport": "stdio", "command": "bun", "args": ["mcp/domain-docs.ts"], "cwd": "." }
  ],
  "system_appendix": [{ "name": "domain-policy", "path": "prompts/system-appendix.md" }],
  "agent-appendix": [{ "agent": "executor", "name": "domain-executor", "path": "prompts/executor-appendix.md" }]
}
```

### Surfaces (the only allowed extension points)

| Surface | Purpose | Additive rule |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| `subskills` | Inline sub-skills bound to an existing skill/agent (`binds_to`/`phase`/`activation_arg`) | Two-tier (see below) |
| `tools` | Always-on custom tools (object entries) or legacy subskill-scoped string paths | Additive; manifest-declared name is authoritative, never overwrites an existing tool |
| `hooks` | Constrained event hooks bound to a declared `event`/`target`/`phase` | Additive; run alongside built-ins, never replace |
| `mcps` | MCP servers (`stdio`/`http`/`sse`); the Claude Code `mcpServers` map alias is accepted and normalized to this | Additive; server-name collisions are hard errors |
| `system_appendix` | Lower-authority text appended to the default agent system prompt | Append-only, never overrides base |
| `agent-appendix` | Lower-authority text appended to an existing role agent's prompt | Append-only per named agent |

### Compatibility aliases, forbidden, and unsupported keys

**Accepted aliases** — normalized into the canonical compiled representation at parse time, so a manifest using the alias compiles to byte-equivalent surfaces as the canonical spelling:

- `mcpServers` (Claude Code / loose mcp.json map, server name → config) → normalized into the canonical `mcps` array. Per-server `type` maps to `transport`; `command` implies `stdio` and a bare `url` implies `http` when `type` is absent. Only transport-relevant fields with an end-to-end bundle runtime equivalent are accepted (`type` plus `command`/`args`/`cwd` for `stdio`, or `url` for `http`/`sse`); anything else is a targeted migration diagnostic (see below).

**Targeted migration diagnostics** — the alias shape cannot be preserved, so the manifest fails with an actionable suggested canonical form instead of a generic unknown/forbidden-key error:

- `mcp` (singular) — ambiguous shape; use canonical `mcps` or the `mcpServers` alias.
- `skills` (top level) — bundles may only EXTEND the four protected workflow skills; use `subskills` or the loose `.gjc/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` surface. Never silently replaced by a bundle (`forbidden_surface`).
- `agents` (Claude Code plugin.json) — top-level agents are protected; use `subskills` bound to `executor`/`architect`/`planner`/`critic` (`forbidden_surface`).
- `commands` / `slash-commands` (Claude Code plugin.json) — bundles cannot register slash commands; use the loose `.gjc/commands/<name>` surface (`forbidden_surface`).
- `hooks` written as a Claude Code plugin.json event-keyed map or `{ matcher, hooks, source }` entries — cannot be preserved as constrained GJC bundle hooks; use canonical `{ name, event, target?, phase?, path }` or the loose `.gjc/hooks/pre|post/<tool>.ts` surface (`invalid_manifest`).
- `mcpServers` entries using `env`/`auth`/`oauth`/`headers`/`enabled`/`timeout`/`autoload`/`noInheritEnv`, or fields incompatible with the selected transport — the bundle runtime cannot preserve these semantics end to end. Move the server to canonical loose `.gjc/mcp.json` (directly or through the `/extensions` import flow in #4291) or drop the field (`unsupported_surface`).
- Any unknown top-level key — names the full canonical key set.

**Never accepted in any form:** `mcps` + `mcpServers` together, an `mcpServers` entry that cannot determine a transport, and any per-server key outside the accepted vocabulary.

## Installation

```sh
gjc plugin install <path|git-url|tarball> --user      # install into the user root
gjc plugin install <path|git-url|tarball> --project   # install into the project root
```

Exactly one of `--user` / `--project` is required for GJC plugin bundles (there is no default root). A source containing `gajae-plugin.json` is classified as a GJC bundle and routed to the bundle installer **before** the marketplace/npm path; non-bundle sources fall through to the legacy flow.

Install is **compile-validate-then-copy**:

1. The bundle is compiled and validated **without importing any plugin code** (manifest, frontmatter, and declared files are read as bytes only).
2. Collision and MCP security policy are enforced (the durable registry is the collision authority — never capability "first-wins").
3. Only the validated, hashed files are copied into a temp sibling, then atomically renamed into place; the registry entry is written last under a per-scope lock. Nothing is mutated on failure.

Idempotency: re-installing identical content is a no-op; different content requires `--force`.

## Security model

- **Install validation never executes plugin code.** Tool/hook names are manifest-declared; at runtime the loaded factory must return/register exactly the declared name/event or the surface is quarantined (`runtime_mismatch`).
- **MCP policy** (install + runtime connect): HTTPS-only for `http`/`sse`; private/loopback/link-local/unique-local/multicast and the `169.254.169.254` metadata endpoint are denied across IPv4, IPv6, IPv4-mapped/compatible, zone-id and trailing-dot forms; URL credentials and CRLF headers are rejected; DNS is re-resolved before connect (rebinding defence). `stdio` servers are confined to the plugin root (allowed launchers `node`/`bun` or a root-confined executable; required bundled script argument; no eval/loader flags; no env expansion).
- **Hooks** run through a *constrained* API: only a handler for the declared event may be registered. `registerCommand`, `sendMessage`, `appendEntry`, renderer registration, and shell `exec` are denied (`security_policy`). The broad first-party hook API is never exposed to bundle hooks.
- **Appendices** render as lower-authority, delimited `<gjc-plugin-system-appendix>` / `<gjc-plugin-agent-appendix>` blocks appended after the base/project prompt; size-capped (8 KiB/appendix, 32 KiB total) fail-closed; content is escaped and control-char sanitized. They can never override base/developer instructions.
- **Hash drift**: installed files are re-verified against the registry at session start; any drift quarantines the plugin (`runtime_mismatch`).

## Sub-skills: Tier-1 vs Tier-2

- **Tier-1 advertisement** (metadata-only): when a parent skill/agent prompt is built, installed sub-skills bound to it are advertised as a bounded list (`plugin` / `name` / `description` / `activation_arg` / `phase`; max 12 items, 200-char descriptions, 4 KiB block, with an overflow note). No body content; rendered only in the target parent prompt, never the global public-workflow surface.
- **Tier-2 activation** (full body): on explicit activation (e.g. `deep-interview --autoresearch`) or an agent's contextual choice, the full sub-skill body is injected as a `<gjc-subskill>` block at the matching phase.

## Registry, enablement, and quarantine

Each scope keeps a durable `registry.json` recording per-plugin: name/version, source (`path`/`git`/`tarball` + ref/sha), manifest hash, copied files (relative path + sha256 — the uninstall ownership boundary), per-surface extension IDs, `enabled` flag, `disabledSurfaceIds`, and any `quarantine` entries.

Extension IDs are stable: `tool:<name>`, `hook:<event>:<phase>:<target>:<name>`, `mcp:<name>`, `system-appendix:<plugin>:<name>`, `agent-appendix:<agent>:<plugin>:<name>`, `subskill:<parent>:<phase>:<activation_arg>`. Disabled is user-controlled (not an error); quarantine is fail-closed and visible.

## Status / scope notes

- Always-on **tools**, **system appendices**, **agent appendices**, and **Tier-1 advertisement** activate at session start (additive; no-op when no bundle is installed).
- **MCP runtime connection** and the **live hook runner** integration are gated behind the same validated registry + policy; consult the ledger/run notes for their wiring status.
- Install, force update (`gjc plugin upgrade`), enable/disable, uninstall, quarantine, and hash-drift are covered by the lifecycle suite; the registry records everything required for them (per-surface IDs + copied-file ownership).
