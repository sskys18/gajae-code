# unlazy

**An anti-laziness skill for AI agents.**
Built around the Depth Tree method: split the task N layers deep,
then give every leaf the full time budget of the whole task.

Effort multiplies with depth. It never divides.

Works with Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor and anything else that reads `SKILL.md`.

## Use it

Install once, then invoke it in plain language. The skill also triggers on its own when your request matches its description.

```
/unlazy tree 5 refactor the payment module
```

```
tree 4 this bug hunt and do not stop until it is done
```

`tree N` means: split the task N layers deep, and every leaf at the bottom gets the full time budget of the whole task. `tree 3` is 4 units of work, `tree 5` is 16, `tree 7` is 64. Pick the depth by how badly you want it done.

### Install

**Any agent, via the [skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)** (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and more; it detects what you have):

```bash
npx skills add Leonxlnx/unlazy
```

Add `-g` for a user-level install or `--all` for every detected agent, non-interactively.

**Claude Code, manually:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Leonxlnx/unlazy ~/.claude/skills/unlazy
```

**OpenAI Codex CLI, manually** (invoke with `$unlazy` or let it trigger on the description):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Leonxlnx/unlazy ~/.codex/skills/unlazy
```

**Everything else:** [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) is a plain markdown file. Paste it as a system prompt, a Cursor rule, or a preamble. The method is model-agnostic.

### Or let your agent install it

Paste this to Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or any agent with shell access:

```
Install the "unlazy" skill from https://github.com/Leonxlnx/unlazy so it is
available to you in future sessions.

Try `npx skills add Leonxlnx/unlazy -y` first. If that is unavailable, clone
the repo into your own skills directory instead: ~/.claude/skills/unlazy for
Claude Code, ~/.codex/skills/unlazy for Codex CLI, or the equivalent path for
whatever agent you are.

Then confirm it worked: show me the installed path and the first line of the
skill's description. Do not tell me it is installed unless you have actually
verified the file is on disk.
```

## The problem: model laziness is real and measured

"Laziness" sounds like a vibe. It is not. Recent work defines and measures it directly:

- A December 2025 paper defines LLM laziness as **premature truncation of responses and partial compliance with multi-part requests**, and finds widespread compliance failures on detailed multi-part instructions even under explicit prompting ([Quantifying Laziness, arXiv 2512.20662](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20662)).
- Reasoning models **abandon promising lines of thought prematurely**, a failure named underthinking ([Thoughts Are All Over the Place, arXiv 2501.18585](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18585)). The inverse also exists: models burn compute deliberating instead of acting ([When More Thinking Hurts, arXiv 2604.10739](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.10739)), and ICLR 2026 ships a benchmark that scores both at once ([OptimalThinkingBench, arXiv 2508.13141](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13141)).
- Coding agents **degrade over long-horizon iterative work**: on SlopCodeBench the best agent solves 14.8 percent, with verbosity and code erosion growing several times faster than in human repositories ([arXiv 2603.24755](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.24755)).
- Agents take shortcuts when they believe resources are running out. Cognition found Claude Sonnet 4.5 **underestimated its remaining context and wrapped up early**, a behavior now called context anxiety ([Inkeep's writeup](https://inkeep.com/blog/context-anxiety)).
- The failure is mainstream enough that business press covers it: advanced models showing signs of laziness is a named risk for companies betting on agents ([Fortune, July 2026](https://fortune.com/2026/07/28/advanced-ai-models-laziness-open-ai-anthropic/)).

One concrete, painful example of the genre: an agent given 80 files to fix reported all 80 done, with a confident report to back it up. It had opened 11.

The upside is equally well measured. Effort is steerable. Appending a single "Wait" token and suppressing the end of thinking, called budget forcing, lifts competition math scores by double digits ([s1: Simple test-time scaling, arXiv 2501.19393](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393)). Aider cut lazy coding threefold just by changing the edit format ([unified diffs](https://aider.chat/docs/unified-diffs.html)). And the ceiling keeps rising fast: METR measures the length of task agents can complete at 50 percent reliability doubling roughly every four months ([Time Horizon 1.1, January 2026](https://metr.org/blog/2026-1-29-time-horizon-1-1/)).

So: models default to minimum effort, effort responds to structure, and the structure is what this skill supplies.

## The Depth Tree method

Created by [Leonxlnx](https://github.com/Leonxlnx). This is the core of the skill.

### The rules

1. **Estimate T once, at the root.** T is how long the whole task would take done normally, in one competent pass.
2. **Split binary, N layers deep.** Layer 1 is the task. Every node splits in two. Leaves are where all real work happens.
3. **Every leaf gets the full T.** Not a share of it. A leaf that looks trivial still gets the whole budget.
4. **Per leaf, iterate until a pass finds nothing to improve:** implement completely, then critique as an expert, then hunt defects, then polish.
5. **Never stop at "works".** Stop when the budget is spent or improvement genuinely runs dry.

```
tree 3                     X                layer 1: estimate T here
                         /   \
                      X.1     X.2           layer 2: decomposition only
                     /   \   /   \
                   L1    L2 L3    L4        layer 3: 4 leaves, EACH gets full T
```

Total effort is T times 2 to the power of N minus 1. `tree 3` is 4T. `tree 7` is 64T. Depth is not a way of slicing the work thinner. It is a dial that multiplies how much work happens.

### Why it beats "try harder" prompting

Telling a model to be thorough is a vibe request, and models regress to minimum effort under it. The tree converts thoroughness into arithmetic:

- **The budget is explicit and per-leaf.** A leaf cannot end early by feeling finished, because its stop condition is a spent budget or a no-improvement pass, not a sense of completion.
- **Decomposition removes the summary escape hatch.** A model asked for one big thing can hand back a sketch of the whole. A model working leaf 23 of 64 has nothing to summarize. The only move available is the work itself.
- **Re-estimating is forbidden.** The collapse case, where each leaf gets a fresh smaller estimate, quietly restores ordinary effort. Fixing T at the root is what makes depth multiply.
- **It matches how effort actually scales in the research.** Budget forcing works by refusing the stop token. The tree is the same refusal, applied at task scale.

### Battle test

The method was used to build [sakura-realm](https://github.com/Leonxlnx/sakura-realm), a real-time procedural 3D landscape, as a `tree 7` run: 64 leaves across 20 file-disjoint modules, contracts written before fan-out, every module followed by an adversarial verification pass that edited code rather than filing reports. The repo, including a volumetric sky, a weather system and a fully procedural tree, shipped with zero art assets.

## What is in the skill

[SKILL.md](SKILL.md) carries the Depth Tree plus enforcement rules distilled from the research above:

| Rule | Counters |
|---|---|
| No report until done | Premature completion claims |
| Acceptance gates before starting | "Looks plausible" passing as done |
| Verify, do not trust yourself | Confident false reports |
| Continuation forcing ("Wait") | Early stopping |
| Finish one line of attack | Underthinking, strategy hopping |
| Do not simulate work you can do | Overthinking, deliberation instead of action |
| Ignore resource anxiety | Context-anxiety shortcuts |
| Full files, full lists, full sweeps | Silent sampling |
| Banned outputs list | Placeholders, stubs, elisions |
