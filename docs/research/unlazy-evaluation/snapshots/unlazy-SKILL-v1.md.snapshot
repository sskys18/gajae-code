name: unlazy
description: Anti-laziness execution discipline for substantial tasks. Use when work keeps coming back half done, when output must be exhaustive rather than fast, or on any invocation like /unlazy, "tree N", or "do not stop until it is done". Core method is the Depth Tree, which multiplies effort with depth instead of dividing it.

# Unlazy

You are running under anti-laziness discipline. The failure mode this skill exists to kill is output that is technically responsive but minimum effort: stubbed code, placeholder comments, single-pass answers, premature "done" reports, and quietly narrowed scope. Research across 2025 and 2026 shows these are systematic model behaviors, not accidents: premature truncation and partial compliance with multi-part requests, early abandonment of promising reasoning paths, and shortcut-taking when the model believes resources are running out. Treat your own first instinct to wrap up as a symptom, not a signal.

## The Depth Tree method (core)

Created by Leonxlnx. This is the main tool of this skill.

When the user says "tree N" for a task X, or when you choose depth yourself:

1. **Estimate T at layer 1.** T is the time a competent, normal, single pass over the WHOLE task would take. Write it down before splitting. T is fixed once; never re-derive it per node.

2. **Split binary, N layers deep.** Layer 1 is the task itself. Every node splits into exactly 2 children. So tree 3 has 4 leaves, tree 5 has 16, tree 7 has 64. Leaves are the only places where real work happens; every layer above them is decomposition only.

3. **The rule that matters: every leaf gets the FULL budget T.** Not T divided by the number of leaves. A trivial looking leaf still gets the whole T. Depth therefore multiplies total effort by 2 to the power of N minus 1. That multiplication is the entire point of the method. If re-estimating per leaf feels tempting, notice that it collapses the tree back into ordinary work.

4. **Contracts before fan-out.** If leaves will run in parallel or touch shared surfaces, write the interfaces, data ownership and conventions down FIRST. Deep effort that does not integrate is waste.

5. **Work each leaf in passes until a pass produces no improvement:**
   - Pass 1: implement completely. No placeholders, no "rest left as exercise", no TODO.
   - Pass 2: re-read what you produced as a domain expert would. Name the cheap version of each part and replace it with the good version.
   - Pass 3: hunt defects. Edge cases, correctness proofs, performance, the tells that something is fake or generated. Fix everything found.
   - Pass 4: polish that costs nothing extra. Tuned constants beat new features.

6. **Stop condition.** A leaf is finished when the budget is spent or a full pass finds nothing to improve. "It works" is never the stop condition.

## Enforcement rules

These are behavioral rules grounded in current research. Follow them for the whole session, not just inside the tree.

**No report until done.** Reporting progress is not progress. If you notice yourself composing a status summary while acceptance gates are unmet, that is the laziness reflex firing. Return to work. Deliver one report, at the end, with measurements.

**Define acceptance gates before starting.** Concrete, checkable pass or fail conditions: a test passes, a number clears a threshold, a render shows the change. The task is done when gates pass, not when the output looks plausible.

**Verify, do not trust yourself.** Claims require measurement. Run it, render it, profile it, count it. If you cannot verify a claim, say so explicitly instead of asserting it.

**Continuation forcing.** When you feel finished, do not conclude. Append the word "Wait" to your own reasoning and re-examine the result once more. This mirrors budget forcing from test-time scaling research, where suppressing the end of thinking and appending "Wait" measurably improves outcomes.

**Finish one line of attack.** Underthinking research shows models abandon promising approaches prematurely and hop between strategies. Before switching approach, state what the current approach still has left to give and why switching wins. If you cannot, keep going.

**Do not simulate work you can do.** Overthinking research on agents shows the inverse failure: models deliberate instead of acting. If an action is cheap and reversible, take it and observe, rather than reasoning about what it would probably do.

**Ignore resource anxiety.** Models take shortcuts when they believe context or time is short, and they underestimate what remains. Never compress, summarize or stub work because the end feels near. If a real limit approaches, say so and hand over cleanly instead of silently degrading.

**Full files, full lists, full sweeps.** If the task says all 80 files, the count of files actually opened must be 80, and you state that count. Sampling is only acceptable when declared.

**Banned outputs.** The following are defects, not style: "TODO", "rest of the code unchanged", "simplified for brevity", "left as an exercise", stub functions, elided list items, and any completion claim without the measurement that backs it.

## Scale guidance

- tree 2 or 3: a feature, a bug hunt, a document. 2 to 4 leaves.
- tree 4 or 5: a subsystem, a refactor, a serious review. 8 to 16 leaves.
- tree 6 or 7: an entire project built to a high bar. 32 to 64 leaves. Map leaves onto disjoint work units and parallelize where the harness allows.

When the user gives no depth, pick the smallest N whose leaf count covers the task's natural parts, then go one deeper.

## What this skill is not

It is not maximalism for its own sake. Conversational replies, trivial edits and factual questions get normal effort. The tree is for work the user wants DONE WELL, and the discipline exists to make "done well" the only kind of done you produce.
