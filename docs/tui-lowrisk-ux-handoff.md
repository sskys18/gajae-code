# TUI UX batch — handoff

> Planned as a "low-risk" batch. During review it was reclassified as changing public TUI
> behavior and reviewed as high-risk; treat the scope label in the plan accordingly.

Shipped in PR [#4965](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/4965) (merged into `dev`).

Six defects where the TUI rendered an affordance nothing could reach, or discarded information without saying so. The implementation landed in merged PR [#4965](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/gajae-code/pull/4965); this document records the shipped behavior, deliberate follow-ups, and review evidence without depending on private execution history.

## What shipped

| Slice | Fix |
|---|---|
| `nav-palette-entries` | Six navigation actions had a registry callback and predicate but no palette entry and no key dispatch. Now listed through an **opt-in** availability gate (`#availabilityGatedPaletteActions`), with remap loops and `defaultKeys: []`. |
| `todo-hud-expand` | `toggleTodoExpansion()` had zero callers. Now reachable via `alt+shift+t` and an availability-gated palette entry. |
| `nav-keybinding-defaults` | `alt+shift+s`/`f`/`r` for session tree/fork/resume. Data-only; the dispatch loops already existed. |
| `reduced-motion` | New public setting `startup.skipLogoAnimation` (Interaction tab, default `false`), read once at startup. |
| `statusline-overflow` | Silent segment eviction now cued with a width-reserved marker. Count is exact or intentionally absent, never truncated. Eviction **order** unchanged. |
| `editor-registry-routing` | Five `tui.editor.*` chords moved off hard-coded literals onto the registry, plus a `ctrl+backspace` repair for Windows Terminal. |

## Deferred, with rationale

These are seven numbered non-goals from the #4965 review, not oversights. The theme-preset question below is an additional follow-up.

1. **`NO_COLOR` contract** — `Theme.fg`/`Theme.bg` always emit SGR; only `isHyperlinkEnabled` consults `NO_COLOR`. This violates the contract in `packages/coding-agent/src/modes/DESIGN.md`. The #4965 review estimated **103 affected files** under `packages/coding-agent/src` and identified a conflicting raw reverse-video fallback in `src/tools/vim.ts` that must be reversed. Highest-value follow-up; needs its own reviewed change.
2. **Default bindings for the six palette-only nav ids** — `sendNow` and `mode.cycle` sit in `ACTION_HINT_PRIORITY`, so binding them mutates default composer hints. Needs a product decision on hint priority first.
3. **Full curated-palette availability/dispatch migration** — filtering every curated entry (not just the opt-in six) changes visible palette contents for pre-existing thinking, model-cycle, editor, copy, queue and session actions. Two execution models coexist today: pre-existing entries are direct closures, the gated six route through `#executeAction`.
4. **Status-line eviction priority** — `right` is a bare `string[]` with no identity parallel to `leftSegIds`, so a cross-segment priority policy needs new typed provenance and would override the retention users express through configured segment order.
5. **Editor `ctrl+a`/`ctrl+e` precedence** — those literals still shadow the registry-driven `cursorLineStart`/`cursorLineEnd` branches. Named as explicit exceptions in `docs/keybindings.md` so the published contract is accurate rather than silently false.
6. **`app.mode.cycle`** — dispatches byte-identically to `app.plan.toggle` with no distinct behavior. Left unbound; needs a product call on whether it should exist.
7. **Higher-risk research findings, untouched** — unified session hub (merging `SessionsDashboardComponent` with `SessionSelectorComponent`), notification rail, reviewable large-paste cards, inline `CollapsedChatHistoryComponent` recovery.

Also deferred: whether the theme `ascii` symbol preset should govern the truncation ellipsis repo-wide. `Ellipsis.Ascii` is currently unused in `packages/coding-agent/src` and no renderer branches on the preset.

## Known pre-existing failure

The #4965 review recorded `bun run check:ts` failing at `check:sdk-closure` (`sdk-acp-adapter.test.ts`, "SDK internal launch refused: runtime dependency escapes its trusted root"). Treat that as merge-epoch baseline evidence and rerun it against current `dev` before attributing a later CI failure; it does not touch any path modified by this documentation-only handoff.

## Landmines for whoever touches this next

Hard-won during review; worth reading before editing these files.

- **`render()` applies `truncateToWidth` after status rows are built.** An assertion that reads only `render(width)` output cannot distinguish the reserved overflow marker from an ellipsis that truncation manufactured. Two real defects hid behind exactly that. Assert `getPreviewContent(width)` raw rows *before* the rendered ones.
- **`ActionRegistry` memoizes availability per microtask** and clears it on a queued microtask. Tests that flip a predicate and re-probe must yield first.
- **Editing `settings-schema.ts` triggers the mandatory computer-use red-team gate.** It is a shared behavior registry, so the completion gate requires all seven cases (`kill-switch-bypass`, `suspended-enforcement`, `permission-revoked`, `display-stale`, `out-of-bounds-drift`, `runaway-loop-halt`, `blast-radius`) even for a change with no computer-use behavior. A real suite exists at `packages/coding-agent/src/tools/computer.{redteam,enforcement}.test.ts` — run it, do not fabricate cases.
- **`sticky-viewport-showcase` fails fast on the first witness mismatch.** One reported key does not mean one drifted key; enumerate all 20 against a fresh capture. This batch found three.
- **The witness table is an anti-restatement oracle.** `STICKY_VIEWPORT_FRAME_TEXT_WITNESS` and the verifier derivation are both in `ORACLE_SOURCES`. Updating it requires a fresh capture plus an `independent-review.json` whose `reviewer_identity` the verifier machine-checks as distinct from the bundle's `capture-sticky-viewport-showcase` author/executor.
- **Terminal visual evidence has a real contract** (`docs/ui-design-visual-qa.md:62-66`): `terminal.html` must *render* ANSI as styled markup, not print escape notation, and `metadata.json` must carry font/rendering assumptions, capture timestamp, tool version, and live-PTY/replay/fixture mode. A bundle can prove the behavior and still fail this.
- **Test oracles must not iterate the production list under test.** `AVAILABILITY_GATED_NAV_PALETTE_ACTIONS` is asserted against a literal six-id expectation in both suites precisely so removing an id fails a test.
