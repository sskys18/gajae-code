/**
 * Guard: a pull request must not remove released CHANGELOG history.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * `packages/<pkg>/CHANGELOG.md` deliberately has no `merge=union` driver (see the
 * comment in `.gitattributes`): union never conflicts, it concatenates both
 * sides of an overlapping hunk, which silently filed entries into versions that
 * had already shipped. Removing the driver was correct, but it also means a
 * rebase now produces a *real* conflict in these files for the first time — and
 * a bad resolution can drop the file's entire history without any marker.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. Within ten minutes of the driver being removed, ten
 * open pull requests across six authors force-pushed heads whose CHANGELOG was
 * a single newline, having lost every released section. Nothing in CI noticed:
 * the files still parsed, no test read them, and the diff was just a large
 * deletion among a legitimate change.
 *
 * Contract
 * --------
 * Every `## [<version>]` heading present in a `packages/<pkg>/CHANGELOG.md` at the
 * merge base must still be present at the head. Adding headings is fine.
 * Editing entry text is fine. Removing a released section is not.
 *
 * `## [Unreleased]` is exempt in one direction only: it may disappear, because
 * a release commit legitimately consumes it. It may not take released sections
 * with it.
