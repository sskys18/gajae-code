/**
 * The claim that serializes PATHNAME TRANSITIONS of `<file>.lock` among current writers.
 *
 * `<file>.lock` cannot serialize its own creation and removal on its own: a base writer
 * that only ever `open(..., "wx")`s the path is a real contender this protocol cannot
 * exclude, and interleaving its create with a reclaimer's delete is what corrupts
 * ownership. So every current transition of that pathname — acquire, stale reclaim,
 * write-failure cleanup, release — is made under this separate claim. Only pathname
 * bookkeeping happens inside it; the caller's state-file operation never does.
 *
 * The claim is an atomic empty directory at `<file>.lock.transition`; its machine-qualified
 * owner record is the sibling `<file>.lock.transition.owner`. `mkdir` admits exactly one
 * contender, while the held directory prevents a successor until release unlinks the
 * validated sidecar and atomically `rmdir`s the claim. A crash before either step leaves a
 * directory that a successor may reclaim only with proof: a host-qualified owner whose pid
 * is proven dead, plus an exact directory-generation and tree match at removal time.
 *
 * The separate sidecar keeps the claim directory empty, which is what makes `rmdir` the
 * identity-safe portable release primitive. The path stays distinct from `<file>.lock`
 * (whose regular-file owner format base writers read) and from the outer
 * `locks/mutation.lock` (whose generic directory semantics are unchanged).

 * wrote. Only the REMOVAL is taken over, because that protocol can offer nothing better
 * than re-reading a token and then unlinking a pathname — and a successor can change the
 * tree underneath a token that still reads the same.
 *
 * But the verdict is rendered against a PATHNAME, and the object it judged is not the
 * object that would be deleted. A legacy writer takes no transition claim, so it can
 * remove the judged directory and create a brand-new LIVE one at the same path; capturing
 * "whatever is there now" hands the successor's own tree to the exact removal, which then
 * matches and deletes a live lock. The compare-and-delete protected the object it was
 * given — the authorization simply belonged to a different one.
 *
 * So the identity BRACKETS the verdict: the tree is captured before it, captured again
 * after it, and removed only when both captures are the same tree. Any replacement in that
 * window makes the two disagree and the reclaim declines, leaving the successor untouched.
 *
 * Nothing creates such a directory at this path anymore.
