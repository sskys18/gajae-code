/**
 * Herdr agent lifecycle reporter.
 *
 * When gjc runs inside a Herdr pane (`HERDR_ENV=1`), report semantic agent
 * state through Herdr's documented custom-integration API so the pane is
 * recognized as the "gjc" agent in Herdr's sidebar and workspace rollups:
 *
 *   - `idle`    — waiting at the input prompt (also reported at startup)
 *   - `working` — agent turn in progress
 *   - `blocked` — waiting on a user decision (ask tool)
 *
 * The session title is reported through the same API as display-only pane
 * metadata, so a pane shows what it is working on instead of a bare agent
 * label. Herdr renders that title on the pane border and exposes it to the
 * sidebar as the `pane` token.
 *
 * Reporting is strictly best-effort and never blocks or fails a turn. Outside
 * a Herdr pane every entry point is a no-op. Herdr also clears the authority
 * when the pane's foreground process exits, so a hard kill still recovers.
 *
 * Original implementation contributed by @ox8884 (#4318).
