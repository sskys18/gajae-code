/**
 * Fail-atomic user-file writes for the write/edit/LSP writethrough path.
 *
 * The guarantee is visibility, not crash durability: a failed write never
 * publishes partial or truncated bytes, and the destination is left byte-
 * identical. It is deliberately NOT crash-atomic -- the parent directory is
 * never fsynced, so a rename can be lost across a system crash.
 *
 * Publication is last-writer-wins, not conditional. Identity is revalidated
 * immediately before the rename, which rejects a destination that was replaced
 * or retargeted while staging, but `rename(2)` commits against the pathname:
 * a writer that publishes a successor inside the window between that check and
 * the rename is overwritten. Closing that window needs an OS conditional-
 * replace primitive; the exchange-based one available here was removed because
 * it validated only after committing and leaked protocol debris into user
 * directories on every successful write. `write` is a last-writer-wins tool by
 * contract, so this is the documented behavior rather than a silent race.
 *
 * `Bun.write` truncates the destination then copies bytes. A permission or IO
 * failure after that truncate leaves a 0-byte target even though the tool
 * reported an error. Stage to a sibling temp, then rename over the destination
 * so a failed attempt never publishes a truncated file. Directory fsync is
 * intentionally omitted: Windows reports `EPERM` for it (#4457) and user-file
 * publication does not need that durability barrier.
 *
 * Destination symlinks are followed: the referent is replaced, the link stays.
 * The referent is re-resolved immediately before publication so a retargeted
 * link cannot silently repoint the write, and when the lexical destination
 * sits inside a session-scoped `gjc-local` root the resolved referent and its
 * parent must remain inside that root (a link there must not redirect the
 * write out of the trust boundary).
 *
 * Staging uses exclusive create (`wx`) so a colliding leftover temp is never
 * truncated or unlinked; only the temp this call created is cleaned on failure.
 * Existing-file mode and ownership are re-applied after staging so a process
 * umask or replacement inode never changes the target's identity. Hard-linked
 * targets are rejected because replacement would split their link group, and
 * target identity is revalidated before the final same-directory rename. The
 * staged bytes are synced before publication; directory fsync is intentionally not
 * promised because Windows reports EPERM for it (#4457).
