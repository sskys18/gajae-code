/**
 * ACP adapter disposition tests, split from sdk-adapter-dispositions.test.ts
 * (issue #4475): the combined machine-adapter cohorts exceeded the CI 300s
 * file-timeout budget at ~489s of genuine per-fixture runtime (291 production
 * SDK host startups at ~1.7s each). This is not a leaked-resource defect: the
 * process exits ~200ms after the final test. Each adapter cohort runs as its
 * own fresh process under the unchanged timeout.
 *
 * Coverage is byte-identical to the original monolithic file's ACP loop.
