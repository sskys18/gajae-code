# Maintainers

Maintainers own the `gajae-code` repository: they review and merge pull requests,
drive the `dev` → `main` release flow, and are reachable for governance decisions.

## Roster

| GitHub | Role | Access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Yeachan-Heo](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo) | Owner / maintainer | admin |
| [probepark](https://github.com/probepark) | Maintainer | write |
| [snowykr](https://github.com/snowykr) | Maintainer | write |
| [HaD0Yun](https://github.com/HaD0Yun) | Collaborator | write |
| [IYENTeam](https://github.com/IYENTeam) | Collaborator | write |

Access is granted at the GitHub repository level. Because `gajae-code` is owned by
a personal account, GitHub does not expose the org-only `maintain`/`triage` roles;
the closest equivalent is the **write** (push) role, which covers day-to-day
maintenance — pushing to `dev`, reviewing and merging PRs, and managing issues and
PRs. `admin` is reserved for the repository owner.

## Branch and review policy

- All PRs target `dev`. `main` is reserved for maintainer-directed release flow.
- Maintainers review and merge PRs against `dev` and drive releases to `main`.
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the contribution flow and the
  changelog/merge-driver rules that apply to every PR.
